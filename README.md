# PELAB's R-Type and Game Engine üöÄ

This repository contain an open-source ECS developped in C++, this engine is completly modular and who's waiting for you're contribution.

Also, there are a plenty of work to do concerning the other features of the R-Type:

- The network protocol, as any other protocol let space for improvement
- The R-Type game implementation can always be added some more features
- Any other game could be developped using the ECS game engine

And many other things...

<br/>

## Build the project üõ†Ô∏è

After installing the necessary dependencies, in order to build the project, use cmake.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/legolas-tek/r-type.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd r-type
```

Build using cmake

```bash
cmake -Bbuild \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
```

If you specifically wants to build for you're platform, use the right preset.

### For Linux:
```bash
cmake -Bbuild \
--preset linux-amd64 \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
-DDEBUG_NETWORK=1
```

### For Windows:
```bash
cmake -Bbuild \
--preset x64-debug
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

### For macOS:
```bash
cmake -Bbuild \
--preset macos-arm64
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```


Then, you can  finally build

```bash
cmake --build build
```
